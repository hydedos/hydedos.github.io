        macOS Day Planner

        This is a personal project that is very much a work in progress. The idea is to build a desktop application that 
        makes for snappy planning of your day. Most other apps I saw didn't quite fit what I wanted. A lot of applications I 
        saw were too slow in creating, reordering or editing the length of events for my tastes. The plan is to experiment 
        with some macOS features like dark mode and notifications. Right now, there is only a command line interface and 
        limited functionality.

        Room Display

          My year long senior project at WWU was a web application my group called Room Display. Room Display was a scheduling system 
          to replace the paper calendar used by Western Washington Universityâ€™s Computer Science department to arrange 
          use of their conference room. We also extended the functionality to be used as a schedule and information display 
          outside a couple rooms that each acted as multiple professors offices. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This new system has the advantage of 
          allowing access to the schedule outside of the department offices from any device with a web browser, as well as 
          easier creation of recurring events and quicker indication of room reservations at a given date and time. Room 
          Display was written completely in Typescript using React on the front end and Node in the backend.

        Unix Minishell

        <p>
        This minishell replicates some of the classic unix shell features. It is able to execute unix system calls in 
        addition to having some of its own built in commands. The minishell features environment variables, pipes, 
        redirection and command line expansion such as * and ${ENV_VAR}. This project gave me the opportunity to learn a 
        lot about development within a Unix enivornment. The project was written in C.

          An implementation of the board game Deadwood. Players go from set to set taking on different acting roles to
          earn points. Written completely in Java the focus of the project was to get command of object oriented design
          principals. The project also featured a MVC GUI.
